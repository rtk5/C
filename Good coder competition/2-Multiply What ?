I am very passionate about numbers and my Favourite number is K. K is in the range [2,5] both inclusive . Now let's say you are given an array of n numbers and what I want is to make the product of all the numbers of array to be divisible by K.

You can apply the given operation on any number of array :

Opr : Choose an index i (0 <= i < n) and Increment the value of that index by 1. i.e. make arr[i] = arr[i] + 1

You need to find minimum number of opertions needed to fulfil the requirement.

Input Format

First line has N , K (Size of array and Favourite Number)

Next line contains N array elements

Constraints

2 <= N <= 10^5

2 <= K <= 5

Output Format

Minimum number of operations needed.

Sample Input 0

2 5
3 7
Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

In the first test case, we need to choose the index i=0 twice. After that, the array will be a=[5,7] . The product of all the numbers in the array is now 35 which is divisible by 5 .
