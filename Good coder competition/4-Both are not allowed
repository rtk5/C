In a quaint village, there lived a young mathematician named Alice, known for her love of numbers and puzzles. One day, she stumbled upon an intriguing problem.

She was given three positive integers:

N, M, and K. N,M different from the others. These numbers seemed to hold some mystical properties, sparking Alice's curiosity.

With determination in her heart, Alice set out to find the K-th smallest positive integer that was divisible by either N or M, but not both. But she is busy preparing for her ISA's . Can you help her solve this problem

Input Format

1 line containing Space Separated 3 integers : N M K

Constraints

1 <= N,M <= 10^8

N != M

1 <= K <= 10^10

Output Format

Print the K-th smallest positive integer divisible by exactly one of N and M.

Explanation for the Sample

The positive integers divisible by exactly one of 2 and 3 are 2,3,4,8,9,10,â€¦ in ascending order.

Note that 6 is not included because it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

The fifth smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition is 9, so we print 9.

Sample Input 0

2 3 5
Sample Output 0

9
