You have k units of money and you want to distribute it to some people to make them rich. You are given an array of integers A of length N representing current money ith person has .

In one operation you:

1.) Choose an index i such that 0 ≤ i < n−1 and Ai ≤ Ai+1 ie Next person must be atleast as rich as current .

2.) Increase Ai by 1 .

Find the maximum possible value of max(A1,A2,…An) ie Maximum value of Max_element of array or how rich can be the richest person that you can get after performing this operation at most k times.

Input Format

Space Separated integers N K

Array N elements

Constraints

2 <= N <= 1000

1 <= K <= 10^8

1 <= A[i] <= 10^8

Output Format

the maximum possible maximum of the array after performing at most k operations.

Sample Input 0

3 4
1 3 3
Sample Output 0

4
Explanation 0

One possible optimal sequence of operations is: [1,3,3]→[2,3,3]→[2,4,3]→[3,4,3]→[4,4,3]

Max value achieved is : 4

Sample Input 1

5 6
1 3 4 5 1
Sample Output 1

7
Explanation 1

One possible optimal sequence of operations is: [1,3,4,5,1]→[1,4,4,5,1]→[1,5,4,5,1]→[1,5,5,5,1]→[1,5,6,5,1]→[1,6,6,5,1]→[1,7,6,5,1]

Max value : 7
